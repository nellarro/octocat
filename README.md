This assignment was a week one assignment at The Iron Yard. 

We learned about **flex box**. 

At this point, I just learned what a `<div>` tag was earlier that day. 

Great assignment to learn how to understand flexbox. 

###To Do (post graduation)

-Clean up white space.
-Get rid of unnecessary `display: flex`.
-Play around with [color pantomes](https://coolors.co/).
